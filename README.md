### Project Details
To build this projet we used React,which is a JavaScript Library. We also implemented react router here so the pages of the site loads faster than the regular websites.We used firebase authentication system and private route too.For backend used node and express as a framework.For styling we used a combination of vanilla css and bootstrap.
And lastly for storing data we used mongodb which is a nosql database.
